I'm an Oxford-based developer and consultant with a specialism in standards-based information management. In 2004
I co-founded [NetworkedPlanet](http://networkedplanet.com/) to build Topic Maps-based information management systems
for the Microsoft .NET platform. In the intervening years I have also developed hybrid Topic Maps/RDF based solutions;
[BrightstarDB](http://brightstardb.com/) - an open-source RDF triple store; and the [Data Platform](http://dataplatform.co.uk/)
a simple Linked Data publishing solution.

I'm also a keen photographer with no real specialism as such - I just enjoy making pictures. I have a bit of a passion 
for film and for shooting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera">rangefinder cameras</a>, but 
otherwise I'm quite normal. If you like the pictures here, I also have a 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzzed/">stream on Flickr</a> which gets updated a bit more frequently than this blog.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can do so by emailing me as kal AT (the first word in the name of this blog) DOT com.
