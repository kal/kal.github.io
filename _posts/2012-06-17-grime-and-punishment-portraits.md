This is the first selection of images from the "Grime and Punishment" event hosted by Bristol Roller Derby. These are slightly different from my usual derby pics - firstly I went all digital, lugging around the 5D; and secondly I took advantage of the longer lens and the half-time and post-bout to grab some "portraits". Some are straight posed portraits, where I think my lack of any real studio experience shines through ;-), but my preferred ones are then "environmental portraits" - i.e. pictures that focus on one player at some point during the bout.

There are a bunch more action photos to come - though in a separate post I think.
