This page lists my current and older tech projects.
<h1>Software</h1>
Currently I am working on NetworkedPlanet's suite of products. These include:
<ul>
	<li><a title="BrightstarDB website (opens in a new window)" href="http://brightstardb.com" target="_blank">BrightstarDB</a> - a NoSQL database for .NET that happens to also be a native .NET triple store. BrightstarDB also provides its own ORM layer including .NET databinding and LINQ query support.</li>
	<li><a title="Web3 on networkedplanet.com (opens in a new window)" href="http://networkedplanet.com/products/web3" target="_blank">Web3 </a>- NetworkedPlanet's next-generation topic map engine for .NET. Web3 provides a full REST API for topic maps as well as SPARQL Protocol support enabling access from any programming langauge. Web3 also ships with a visual schema editor and an ontology-drive topic map editor both of which run in a browser.</li>
</ul>
Before I started NetworkedPlanet, I was working on a number of open-source Java tools, which I've kept links to here for historical reasons. Unfortunately none of these projects are much maintained at the moment, but the source code is still there for anyone who wants to play.
<ul>
	<li><a title="TM4J website (opens in a new window)" href="http://tm4j.org" target="_blank">TM4J</a> is an open-source (Apache licensed) topic map engine for Java. It includes support for in-memory only processing as well as a range of different persistence options.</li>
	<li>TMTab is a plugin for the <a href="http://smi.stanford.edu/projects/protege/index.html">Protégé</a> ontology editor that allows you to build an ontology that can then be exported as a topic map in standard XTM syntax.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.techquila.com/mdf.html">MDF</a> - the Meta-Data processing Framework, is a Java toolkit for extracting data from a variety of sources and munging it into topic maps or RDF.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.techquila.com/rng-tools.html">RELAX-NG Documentation Tools</a> - are a set of XSLT stylesheets for generating Docbook documentation and SVG graphics from a RELAX-NG schema.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Data</h1>
This site hosts a variety of freely-downloadable topic map data covering a variety of subjects from the diary of Samual Pepys to the W3C XML Schema Specification.

This site is also an archive for some of my older publications an papers, mainly on the subject of topic maps. Newer writing can be found on the <a title="NetworkedPlanet website (new window)" href="http://networkedplanet.com/" target="_blank">NetworkedPlanet website</a>, the <a title="BrightstarDB website (opens in a new window)" href="http://brightstardb.com" target="_blank">BrightstarDB website</a> and of course on this blog.
<h1>Semantics</h1>
The Techquila domain is used as the namespace for a number of <a title="Published Subjects Recommendation on OASIS (opens in a new window)" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tm-pubsubj/docs/recommendations/general.htm" target="_blank">Published Subject Identifiers</a> relating to <a href="http://www.techquila.com/psi/classification/">classification</a>, <a href="http://www.techquila.com/psi/hierarchy/">hierarchical organisation</a> and <a href="../../psi/faceted-classification/">faceted organisation</a> using topic maps. These PSIs will remain on this site, and continue to be maintained as needed.
