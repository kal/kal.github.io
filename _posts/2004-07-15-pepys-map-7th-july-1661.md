The principal event of <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/07/index.php">this day</a> (and the only one we will model) is the burial of Samuel's deceased uncle Robert. As with our previous funeral, the event is modelled as a topic with a participation association which lists the known attendees. In this case, Robert Pepys as the deceased, Samuel and his father as mourners and Mr. Taylor and Mr. Turner as officiating in one respect or another. Interestingly Samuel says that Mr. Taylor "buried" his uncle and Mr. Turner spoke a funeral sermon. In this association, I have modelled both roles as "priest", however, I would happily receive guidance on more specific role types.
