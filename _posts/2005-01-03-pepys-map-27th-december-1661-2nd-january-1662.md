Todays posting is a catch up of the new year period.
Starting from the entries for 1662, I've chosen to make the ordering of events a bit more explicit in the topic map. Rather than relying on sort names to imply an ordering between the events that occur on a day, I now use the start-after role to indicate a sequence of one event following another.
