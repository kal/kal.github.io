The first entry covered today is for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/12/07/index.php">7th December 1661</a> and requires the introduction of a new event type. The events modelled are:
<ul>
<li>Captain Ferrers and Emmanuel Luffe visit Samuel Pepys at home.</li>
<li>Emmanuel Luffe plays Samuel's theoboro (modelled as a performance event).</li>
<li>Ferrers and Luffe breakfast with Pepys.</li>
<li>When they leave, Samuel and Elizabeth discuss purchases for Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Ferrers and Luffe have a run-in with some watermen at Tower Stairs. This is modelled as a conflict event that occurs during Samuel and Elizabeth's discussion event.</li>
<li>During the fight, Emmanuel Luffe receives a head wound. This is modelled as a new type of event - an injury event. The injury event type is subclassed from the health event type. Emmanuel Luffe is modelled as the injured party (a role subclassed from patient).</li>
<li>Luffe returns to Seething Lane and Elizabeth treats his wounds (the travelling event is implied).</li>
<li>Henry Moore and Samuel Pepys visit Ned Montagu at Worcester House but are unable to see him. This is modelled as a visit to Worcester House.</li>
<li>Pepys and Moore dine at Wilkinson's cookhouse.</li>
<li>Samuel works at the Privy Seal.</li>
<li>Samuel travels to the Navy Office by boat.</li>
<li>Samuel works at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Captain Holmes arrives at the Navy office and he talks to Samuel. Amongst other things, Samuel hears of Holmes' opinion of Sir John Minnes. This is all modelled as a discussion event that occurrs during the preceding working event, with John Minnes as the subject of the discussion.</li>
<li>John Cox visits Samuel at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel returns home and writes a letter to his father. Again the travelling event is implied in the change of location for this event from the preceding event.</li>
</ul>
For <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/12/08/index.php">8th December</a>, the following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel receives a letter from William Smallwood, conveying Tom Trice's answer to Pepys' Chancery bill. This is modelled as a correspondence event between Smallwood and Pepys with the subject of the event being Pepys' Chancery bill.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at the Wardrobe with Lady Montagu.</li>
<li>Lady Montagu tells Samuel of the christening of William Rumbold's son Charles. The christening itsel is also modelled as a separate event.</li>
<li>Thomas Pepys (the brother) visits Samuel at his home.</li>
</ul>
