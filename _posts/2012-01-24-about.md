I'm an Oxford-based photographer with no real specialism as such - I just enjoy making pictures. I have a bit of a passion for film and for shooting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder_camera">rangefinder cameras</a>, but otherwise I'm quite normal.

If you like the pictures here, I also have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fuzzed/">stream on Flickr</a> which gets updated a bit more frequently than this blog.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can do so by emailing me as kal AT (the first word in the name of this blog) DOT com.
