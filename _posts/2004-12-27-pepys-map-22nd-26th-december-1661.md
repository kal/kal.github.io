A catch up over the christmas period, with entries posted for 22nd to 26th of December.
One point worth noting is that the PSIs I am using for dates are based on the Gregorian calender, meaning that they roll over from December 1661 to January 1662 in this period. I am using the "common" convention of the new year starting on January 1st, rather than the ecclesiastical year start.
