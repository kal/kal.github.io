Entries for the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/11/index.php">11th</a> and <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/12/index.php">12th</a> September posted today. Both entries are relatively straightforward to model. There is much discussion with regards to money owed to Tom Trice. I have classified all of this under the subject of "Robert Pepys Estate" as this is where the debt has arisen from.
