<p>In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/05/index.php">today's entry</a>, Samuel travels to Brampton where he sees his father, on to Yelling where he meets his cousin Nightingale and discusses his Gravely lands with her.  Following this conversation (specific details are not reported) he travels on to Gravely where he has a conversation with one of his tenants.</p>

<p>No new ontological development to report; however, I noticed in my print copy that the church in Impington where Samuel attends services <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/04/index.php">yesterday</a> is St Andrews (I left it unidentified in the topic map).  I've amended the topic map for that day, and uploaded it as well.</p>
