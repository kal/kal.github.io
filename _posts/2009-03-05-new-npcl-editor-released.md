If any of you are using NPCL to write your topic map ontologies, you should know that we have just released a new version of the NPCL Schema Editor. Includes MSBuild support, compiling multiple NPCL files into a single file, auto-generated documentation and much much more. Fun for all the family and competitively priced at $0.
