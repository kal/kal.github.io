<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/14/index.php">Today's entry</a> has the following events modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel does some work at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel visits the Royal Exchange.</li>
<li>Thomas Fenner visits Samuel at his home.</li>
<li>Robert and Elizabeth Slingsby (and unidentified others) call for the Samuel and Elizabeth.</li>
<li>Thomas Fenner and Thomas Pepys are left at Samuel's house to dine.</li>
<li>Samuel and Robert Slingsby and their wives go to see four yachts on the river.</li>
</ul>
For the moment, I have modelled the last event as a generic "recreation-event" and made the yachts the "subject" of that event. When the ontology is reviewed it might be worth seeing if there is a subclass of recreation-event that can be extracted from this perhaps "viewing-event" ?
