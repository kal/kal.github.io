Its been a long while since I updated this blog. The past months have been filled with a lot of exciting roller derby photography and as I now have a few days of break from my "real job", it gives me a bit of time to post some of the images that have been gathering on my computer.

This first batch is from a bout between Oxford Roller Derby and Rebellion Roller Derby in November of last year. This was the final bout in the "End of the World" Series - a year long roller derby tournament between 6 teams. The bout was a hard fight with Rebellion coming out on top to take second place overall in the series with Oxford coming third.
