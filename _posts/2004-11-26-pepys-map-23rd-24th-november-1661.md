Two more entries posted today.
In the entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/23/index.php">23rd November 1661</a> the following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth travel to Westminster. We are not told the method of travel.</li>
<li>Elizabeth visits her father.</li>
<li>The couple return home (we are not told what Samuel did while Elizabeth was at her father's).</li>
<li>Samuel works at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel and Peter Pett travel to Cheapside by coach...</li>
<li>...where Samuel meets with the portait painter Savill.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at the Wardrobe.</li>
<li>More work at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel, Williams Penn and Batten and George Cocke drink and play cards at Samuel's house. This is modelled as two separate events -  a recreation event and a drinking event that overlap.</li>
<li>William Penn dines with the Pepys.</li>
<li>Samuel also tells us that he has sent a chine of beef to William Wight as a gift. This is modelled as a gift-event.</li>
</ul>
For <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/24/index.php">24th November 1661</a>, the following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel and George Cocke attend church at St. Clements Eastcheap. The sermon is given by Josias Alsop.</li>
<li>Samuel and George Cocke go for a drink at the Sun tavern on Threadneedle St.</li>
<li>Samuel visits Lady Jemima Montagu at the Wardrobe and while there has dinner. This is modelled as a visiting event with a dining event occurring during it.</li>
<li>Samuel visits Jane Turner, who we are told is ill. The visit is modelled as one event and the illness as a separate event starting before this day.</li>
<li>Samuel drinks with John Young and Daniel Rawlinson at the Mitre.</li>
<li>Samuel dines with William Batten.</li>
<li>Samuel receives an invitation to dinner from William Wight. As Pepys makes it obvious that this is a result of the gift he made the previous day, I have added a cause-result association between the gift event and the correspondence event for the receipt of the invitation.</li>
</ul>
