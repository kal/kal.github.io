Two more entries posted today.
In the entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/10/23/index.php">23rd October 1661</a>, the following events are modelled:
<ul><li>Samuel breakfasts with William Penn and Daniel Tresswell at Tresswell's lodgings in Whitehall.</li>
<li>Samuel dines with William Penn at the Leg tavern in King Street.</li>
<li>Samuel and Penn take a coach to the Lord Privy Seal's home in Chelsea.</li>
<li>Samuel and Penn discuss business of Penn's with the Lord Privy Seal. Is this the same business as referred to in the <a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/000125.html">entry for 21st October 1661</a> ? It is not clear from the entry, so I have not set an event subject for this event.</li>
<li>Samuel attends another performance of 'Love and Honour' at the Opera.</li>
<li>Samuel visits Robert Slingsby at his home.</li>
<li>Thomas Holliard calls on Robert Slingsby while Sam is there. It seems from the entry that Holliard might have offered medical advice to both Pepys and Slingsby, but there is nothing concrete to model.</li>
</ul>
In this day's entry, Samuel also mentions that the workers at the Navy Office have been invited to the Lord Mayor's dinner. At present I am not sure of the best way to model this. It could be a form of correspondence event, although the way it is described I think that it might be second-hand news received from Slingsby (who is Sam's boss at the Navy Office). I've flagged this as a TODO in the LTM topic map for today.
The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/10/24/index.php">24th October 1661</a> is modelled as follows:
<ul><li>Samuel works at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel dines with Peter Llewellyn. We are not told where (perhaps at the Pepys' home ?)</li>
<li>Samuel visits Robert Slingsby at his home.</li>
</ul>
