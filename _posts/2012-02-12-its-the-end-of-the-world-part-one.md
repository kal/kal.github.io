Last week was the End of the World, the roller-zombie-pocalypse and it was happening in Milton Keynes. My first time shooting a rollerderby bout and hopefully the first of many!

Thanks to <a href="http://www.oxfordrollerderby.co.uk/">Oxford Roller Derby</a> for sorting out my access; to <a href="http://mkrollerderby.wordpress.com/">Milton Keynes Concrete Cows</a> for putting on an amazing event and to the <a href="http://www.vendettavixens.com/">Vendetta Vixens</a> and <a href="http://www.rebellionrollerderby.co.uk/">Rebellion Rollerderby</a> for putting on a great first game. If you've never seen Roller Derby before, its a fast-paced cross between rugby and speed-skating in fishnets. The teams in this event are celebrating the Mayan year of doom in style with an <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-End-of-the-World-Series-UK-Roller-Derby/247618371961324">End of the World Series</a> (I only just saw what they did there...) and my home team of Oxford are next skating in Swansea on 3rd of March in <a href="http://www.wegottickets.com/event/154920">This is Derby</a>, get tickets...go see!

Technical Info: Zeiss Ikon and Leica M4, loaded with Portra 400 and Tri-X both pushed a stop but processed as normal.
