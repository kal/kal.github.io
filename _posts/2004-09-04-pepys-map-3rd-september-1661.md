The main event in <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/03/index.php">today's entry</a> is the christening of Catherine Montague. This is modelled using a new event type "christening" subclassed from "church-service" (although it actually takes place at the Wardrobe and not in a church).
Two other events require extensions to the ontology.
Samuel takes delivery of some furniture from Richard Howells - using the existing "purchasing" event type for this does not work as there is no exchange of money at this point.
The other event is Sam's argument with his mother. The "argument" event type is subclassed from the "discussion" event type. I've added an occurrence to this event that gives Samuel's side of the story at least.
