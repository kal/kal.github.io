<p>In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/03/index.php">today's entry</a>, the following events are modelled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samuel rides to Barkway, en route to Cambridge, where he meets a letter-carrier.</li>
<li>He carries on to Cambridge with the letter-carrier.</li>
<li>He visits his cousin at the Assizes at Castle Hill.</li>
<li>He dines with his cousins Roger and John, and a gentleman named Claxton.</li>
<li>He drinks in the Rose Tavern with some others.</li>
<li>He finally travels to Impington with his cousins.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much development today (phew!). I created an instance of Assizes for the Cambridge Assizes, and did a bit of research to find the Pepys' house in Impington was Impington Hall. Samuel mentions travelling to Impington with Roger Pepys &#x201c;and his two brothers&#x201d;, but the only brother of Roger I can identify is (Dr) John Pepys, so I have had to create a local topic for him (Unnamed brother of Roger Pepys).  Should he ever be identified the PSI can be added.</p>
