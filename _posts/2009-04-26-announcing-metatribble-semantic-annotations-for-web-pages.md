Its a pleasure to announce the first release of Metatribble, an attempt to implement some of the concepts of semantic annotation that I talked about in a previous post. Metatribble is currently packaged as a Ubiquity command and right now doesn't do an awful lot except for mark up interesting entities with RDFa, but even just that is kinda cool :-)

To this stage the project has been a collaboration between myself and <a href="http://surguy.net">Inigo Surguy</a>, but making use of the tremendous work done by <a href="http://jenitennison.com">Jeni Tennison</a> on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rdfquery">rdfquery</a> plugin for jQuery - we are truely standing on the shoulders of giants here. We would welcome any comments/suggestions/offers of help.

Links to the project and its source code and the installer for Ubiquity can all be found on the <a href="http://kal.github.com/metatribble">Metatribble project homepage</a>.

BTW We are designating this release a zeta because the concept of "beta" has been somewhat devalued by beta-ware such as gmail, we feel we need to wrap around the alphabet.
