An update has been posted for the RELAX-NG to SVG stylesheets.
The stylesheets now handle the anyName element for elements and attributes. The build file now handles the optional parameters better so start-names and start-patterns can be omitted from build.properties or from the Ant command-line.
Download the update from <a href="http://www.techquila.com/download/rng-tools/rng-svg-latest.zip">here</a>. A sample output file (an SVG of the RELAX-NG schema) can be seen <a href="http://www.techquila.com/download/rng-tools/relaxng.svg">here</a> (SVG file - requires a plugin or viewer such as Apache Batik).
An overview of the Techquila RELAX-NG tools is <a href="/rng-tools.html">here</a>.
