Today's entry is another straightforward one in modelling terms. The events modelled are:
<ul>
<li>Samuel goes to the late Julian Kite's home to meet with his uncle Thomas Fenner and make arrangements for the burial. This is modelled as a visiting event with Thomas Fenner as the "visited" and the Kites' house as the place.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at home.</li>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth go to their church.</li>
<li>The funeral of Julian Kite. I have included Thomas Fenner and Margaret Kite in the mourners. The diary says that there is Fenner's family present, but I have not made an exhaustive list of them here. This may be added later if it becomes important.</li>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth accompany Margaret Kite back to her house.</li>
<li>Samuel, Elizabeth and William Joyce travel back to the Pepys' home.</li>
<li>Samuel and William have a drink back at the house.</li>
</ul>
