Two more entries posted today. The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1662/02/23/index.php">23rd February 1662</a> is quite short with only two events:
<ul><li>Samuel reads more of Fuller's 'A History of the worthies of England'.</li>
<li>William Penn sups with Samuel at his home.</li></ul>
The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1662/02/24/index.php">24th February 1662</a> models the following events:
<ul>
<li>Samuel takes a music lesson from John Birchensha.</li>
<li>Samuel pays 5l. for the lessons he has had in the last month. This is modelled as the new 'payment' event described in <a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/000170.html">this post</a>.</li>
<li>Samuel visits Mr Savill to 'set again for my picture in little' - I'm not sure if this means that Sam is sitting for a miniature to be painted or if it is related to the financing of the original portraits. For now I have simply modelled this as a visit.</li>
<li>Samuel visits John Birchensha at his home in Soutwark. Where the pair discuss and play more music.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at home.</li>
<li>Samuel chastises Will Hewer before his wife. To model this, I have created one participation association for Samuel chastising Will and a separate one for Elizabeth playing the role of 'audience'.</li>
</ul>
