<p>In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/24/index.php">today's entry</a> Samuel works in the office, and then visits Sir William Batten to visit a &#x2018;strange creature &#x2019; (a primate of some species) from brought Guinea by Captain Holmes.  He then visits Richard Ford with Colonel Slingsby to dicuss the rental of Ford's house by the Navy Office (it is adjacent to the current premises).  He is visited at home by Henry Isham, with whom he drinks in the Mitre.  A commended performance of Hamlet is followed by more drinking with a John Spong in the Sampson.

<p>Quite a bit of development today.  I've added a grounds-of association, as we seem to be having a number of places which are in the grounds of another (St Paul's Churchyard, Hatfield House vinyard, etc.).  I've also created creature and a primate subclass for the strange creature, and a generic place-of-origin association which is intended to cover everything from nationality to object source.</p>
