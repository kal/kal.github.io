Catching up again with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/07/index.php">two</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/08/index.php">entries</a> posted today.
The entry for the 7th September introduces one modelling issue, when William Joyce arrives to discuss the hiring of one of his maids. For this, I have modelled the two offices held by the maid and made the office to be held with the Pepys as the subject for the conversation with William Joyce. Once again this makes use of the "trick" of making on event the subject of another. Another possibility would have been to model the hiring of the maid as an event in its own right.
