<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/01/index.php">Today's entry</a> has the following events modelled:
<ul><li>Samuel and Wiilliam Penn travel to Westminster by coach.</li><li>Samuel does business with Ned Montagu.</li><li>Samuel meets William Penn at Whitehall</li><li>Samuel and Penn dine at the 3 Tuns at Charing Cross, and then go on to the theatre for a performance of 'The Jovial Crew'</li><li>Samuel, Penn and Penn's son (also William and latterly the more famous of the two) dine at Samuel's house.</li></ul>
The diary mentions that Penn the younger is "lately come from Oxford". I wonder if this is because it is the end of term or if it is as a result of his expulsion (he was expelled from Christ Church for being a Quaker). If it is the latter, then it might be quite good to add this as another event.
