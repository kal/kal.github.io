Photos from Oxford Roller Derby's bout against the Swansea Slayers on 3rd March 2012. Once again the Oxford team put on a great show - didn't get the win but definitely pushed the Swansea Slayers hard at times. For my money the stars of the match jammer-wise were Swanseas Pixie of Pain, and Oxford's Kapow. From the blockers it was pretty hard to pick (to my untrained eye). The home crowd was way bigger than the crowd for the visitors, but I'm pretty sure our side was louder.

Congrats to the Swansea Slayers on putting together a great afternoon of Roller Derby - more pictures from the supporting bout to come soon...

Technical Stuff: Again I was there trying to keep up with the action with a couple of manual focus film cameras. This time I kept it simpler, 50mm lens on one, 90mm on the other with no lens swapping, both pretty much shot wide open all the time to cope with the poor indoor lighting. The film is Portra 400, pushed to 800 ISO...which I am starting to love.
