From <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/25/index.php">today's entry</a> the following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel receives a box of his uncle's papers.</li>
<li>Samuel visits the Royal Exchange, where he meets his uncle Wight and discusses his father.</li>
<li>A visit to his mother.</li>
<li>A trip to the theatre.</li>
<li>Finally, he writes a letter to his father.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->
As Samuel both receives and sends correspondence today, I thought I would add some topics for correspondence.  A correspondence event topic has been created to cover both sending and receipt of correspondence, and then a simple participation association is used to document sender, sender address, recipient, receipient address, and the item involved.  If required, we can develop a more structured view of this later.
