Catching up with <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/26/index.php">three</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/27/index.php">diary</a> <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/28/index.php">entries</a>.
One new use of the event-based structure has turned up in these entries. In the entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/27/index.php">27th August</a>, Samuel has a discussion with Lady Montague about the preparations Ned Montague is making for a journey to be undertaken by Sir Edward Montague. In particular, that Ned has spent some 5000 pounds on this. This is modelled as a discussion event, the subject of which is a purchasing event where the purchased item is the future journey which is itself represented as a travelling event.
A similar structure is used in the entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/28/index.php">28th August</a> where Samuel plays a prank on Sir William Penn by forging a letter which purports to be from the thief who stole a tankard from Penn recently. Hence the theft event is made the subject of the corresepondence event that represents the sending of the letter.
