<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/09/index.php">Today's entry</a> is something of an instruction in how Mondays should really be approached. The events modelled today:
<ul>
<li>Samuel goes to Privy Seal to get some work done, but finds the Lord Privy Seal not arrived yet.</li>
<li>Samuel meets Captain Robert Morris (with the superb office of Upholsterer-extra-ordinary to the Royal Household), and the two have breakfast togther at the King's Privy Kitchen. During which Samuel drinks too much wine (for breakfast!)</li>
<li>Unable to do any work, Samuel goes first for a walk in Westminster Hall and then to the theatre.</li>
<li>Finally, Samuel returns home, finding that Williams Penn and Batten had called for him. He catches up with them and several others at the Dolphin to round of the day with some more drink.</li>
</ul>
