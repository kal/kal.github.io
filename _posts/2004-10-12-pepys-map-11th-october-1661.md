A very short <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/10/11/index.php">entry</a> today as Pepys is suffering from a 'bruise' which keeps him in bed all day. The only event is the arrival of his brother Thomas, cousin Thomas and John Snow (a relative by marriage) for dinner which Pepys himself is not able to attend.
However, I seem to have inadvertently censored Pepys illness from yesterdays topicmap (possibly because the thought of a 'late bruise in one of my testicles' is just a bit <em>too</em> painful). So that has been added, with 10th October recorded as the start date.
