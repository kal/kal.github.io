In the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/27/index.php">entry for 27th September</a> we find a form of gift event. Lady Montague receives grapes and melons sent by her husband and brought by Captain Country. This is modelled as a gift-event, with a new role of 'courier' added which is played by Country:
<pre>[event-16610927-05 : gift-event = "Richard Country brings exotic fruits from Sir Edward Montague (27th September 1661)";"16610927-05"]
occurs(event-16610927-05 : event, today : on)
participation(event-16610927-05 : event,
jemima-montague : recipient,
richard-country : courier,
sir-edward-montague : giver,
melons : gift,
grapes : gift,
wardrobe-court : place)</pre>
A similar form is used for the melons delivered to Samuel - although in this case the courier is not known.
The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/28/index.php">28th September</a> is very straightforward with only four events modelled. The play "Father's Own Son" is a comedy written by John Fletcher and also known as "Monsieur Thomas".
