Posting two more entries today.
Events for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/06/index.php">6th November 1661</a> are:
<ul>
<li>Samuel breakfasts with John Davenport, Mr. Furbisher and William Bernard at the Sun tavern. A breakfast of wine, anchovies and pickled oysters doesn't seem like the best way to start the day to me.</li>
<li>Samuel goes from the breakfast to dinner with Nicholas Osborne and his wife at the Victualling Office.</li>
<li>Sam visits Henry Moore (we are not told where the visit takes place).</li>
<li>Samuel goes to see the Lord Privy Seal on business.</li>
<li>Samuel plays the lute at home (modelled as a performance event).</li>
</ul>
Events for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/07/index.php">7th November 1661</a> are:
<ul>
<li>Roger Hill visits Samuel at his home. I have not modelled Mr. Hill's desire to teach Samuel to play the Theoboro, nor Samuel's determination for him not to.</li>
<li>Samuel works at the Navy Office</li>
<li>Peter Pett dines as a guest of Samuel's</li>
<li>Samuel calls on Tom Trice and they discuss a writ that Trice is to serve against Samuel's father. The writ is modelled as an item that is the subject of the discussion event used to describe this meeting.</li>
<li>Samuel visits Dr. Williams.</li>
<li>Samuel visits Henry Moore for advice. I have assumed that the advice Samuel seeks is on the writ, and so I have made the writ the subject of the discussion event that describes this meeting.</li>
<li>Samuel calls on Thomas Fenner.</li>
<li>Samuel receives a letter from Sir Edward Montagu in Lisbon.</li>
</ul>
