From <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/23/index.php">today's entry</a> the following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel visits William Penn and William Batten - although it is not crystal clear from the text, I have modelled this as two separate visiting events.</li>
<li>Samuel goes to Westminster Hall, during which Samuel meets Ann Mitchell (a bookseller at Westminster).</li>
<li>A performance of the play "Brennoralt" at the Theatre Royal, attended by Samuel and also by Barbara Villiers (the King's mistress - a new association type 'lover-of' has been introduced to model this relationship).</li>
<li>A discussion between Samuel and his uncle Thomas about the estate of Robert Pepys.</li>
<li>Samuel meets meets with his aunt Mary Wight.</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->
This last event is a little tricky as Samuel had intended to visit his uncle William Wight, but on finding him out stayed for a while with his aunt. The question is whether intention should be modelled in the topic map and if so, how. Alternatively (and the approach I have taken) we simply model the reported facts and not the reported intention - thus we can say that Samuel had an unintentional "meeting" with his aunt (if his uncle had been in, then the event would have been an intentional "visit").
Finally there is the mention of Pepys' sister "Pall" - however as this mention is not linked in to any particular event, I currently lack the means to model it. I could, of course, create a "mentioned" association between the topic representing "Pall" with a topic representing the diary entry, but then by extension every other person and place mentioned by the diary should also be associated in this way. For now my decision is to leave out the mention and continue to focus just on modelling the people, places and events reported in the diary and to leave out modelling of intentions or thoughts.
