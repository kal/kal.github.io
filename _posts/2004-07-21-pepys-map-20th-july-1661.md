<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/20/index.php">Today's entry</a> centers around Samuel's trip to Huntingdon. No details are given about his journey there, so this is not modelled explicity as a separate topic. Rather the diary entry starts with his visit to Sir Robert Bernard. During this visit several other events take place:
1) A discussion with Jaspar Trice about the estate of Robert Pepys
2) A discussion with Sir Robert Bernard about a debt owed to the two men
3) Dinner with Sir Robert Bernard and Lady Digby (Bernard's wife)

<!--more-->
Following this, Samuel visits Lewis Phillips and then meets several people in a tavern identified only as "Mother ???"
The boozing ends at about 9pm according to the diary when Samuel walks home. Seeing as we have more specific details about this journey (start time and method of travel), the journey home is represented by a topic.
The final event described is Samuel's visit to Goody Gorham's alehouse to discuss business with his father, Tom Trice and others.
