You can take the boy out of editorial, but you can't take editorial out of the boy.  A frenzy of correcting and updating means that all the entries for July have been updated, mainly changing events to more suitable types introduced subsequent to the first version.

<ul>
<li>General tidying. Also, the travelling of John Pepys to Brampton which so offends William Wight is not, I think an event occuring today but is the trip reported by Samuel on 30 June (John Pepys is definitely in London on 4th and 6th July, and trip to Brampton takes a couple of days); so I've added that day as the start of the retrospective entries, and amended this entry accordingly.</li>
<li>Added John Battersby's profession (apothecary) to pepys-diary-people, as this is relevant to his discussion with Pepys.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/16610707.ltm">7th July 1661</a></b></p>
<ul><li>As Robert Pepys' estate is a topic in its own right, and is the subject of many discussions in the following month, I have added the reading of the will in the garden as an event.</li>
