I have just had an email from the webmaster of <a href="http://www.charity-ware.org/index.html">Charity-Ware.org</a> an index of software for which the developer asks that money be donated to charity. Did you know that <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> is charity-ware ? Neither did I. Of course, that is part of the problem - and its nice to see an organisation trying to do something about it.
Of course, you don't need to have software in return for giving money to charities like <a href="http://www.shelter.org.uk">Shelter</a> - just donate something! :-)
