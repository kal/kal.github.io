Quite a long <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/19/index.php">diary entry for today</a>.
Samuel spends the first half of the day working at the Navy Office, and then has an errand to run - he has to get the Lord Privy Seal to seal a document for the Lord Chancellor. The errand takes up the best part of the day with Pepys travelling to the chambers of the Privy Seal; the Lord Chancellor's home at Worcester House; and then to the Lord Privy Seal's house at Chelsea (by way of the pub, of course). I have modelled the errand itself as a "Work" event, with the various journies and carousing modelled as separate events that occur during the work event.
Samuel's journey home is eventful too. He has to walk from Chelsea, and on the way meets Mr and Mrs Marsh and they all go drinking together on their way to Westminster.
Other events described in today's entry do not involve Samuel directly. The Montague's children are all summoned to a dinner by their mother,  Elizabeth Pepys dines with her father-in-law, and Katherine Fenner dies.
