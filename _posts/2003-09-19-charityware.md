Feeling inspired by tonight's <a href="http://www.nch.org.uk/bytenight">ByteNight</a> IT charity sleep-out, I was casting around for a way to help my favourite charity, <a href="http://www.shelter.org.uk/">Shelter</a>. Then today I stumbled across <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/">JustGiving</a> and so am now pleased to announce that <a href="/tmtab.html">TMTab</a> and <a href="/mdf.html">MDF</a> are to be made "Charityware".

The basic idea is pretty simple. If you use TMTab or MDF and you find them useful, then please consider making a donation to Shelter through <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/techquila">my sponsorship page</a>. Its pretty easy to do and the money you donate goes towards helping Shelter to help the homeless and those with poor housing. Every penny helps!
