The W3C Persistence Policy (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Persistence">http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Persistence</a>) states how the consortium will guarantee the persistence of documents it publishes in the event of its demise. Seems like one of the documents not covered is the Persistence Policy itself.
Bizarre.
