The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/29/index.php">29th September</a> is quite simple. With just four events: Samuel going to church (twice), a dinner hosted by the Pepys' and a supper hosted by the Penns.
The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/30/index.php">30th September</a> is quite long. I have chosen to focus only on Samuel's own actions rather than the detail of the battle between the French and the Spanish, so the battle itself is referred to only by a single event using a new type 'conflict".
The rest of the days events are principally movements from one place to another, all modelled as travelling events. Samuel's first event of the day was to travel to Whitehall to meet Henry Moore, who did not turn up - hence that is modelled as a travelling-event rather than a meeting-event. Where possible in the rest of the days movements I have recorded the (approximate) start and end points and the mode of travel for each move.
