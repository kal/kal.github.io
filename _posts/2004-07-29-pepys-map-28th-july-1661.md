The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/28/index.php">today</a> is quite short. The Pepys are visited by Mrs Ramsey, with whom they attend church, and then take back home to dine.  They attend church again in the afternoon, and return this time with Sir William Penn.  Elizabeth Pepys then leaves with Penn to visit his daughter, about whom she has disparaging remarks to make.

Not too much development today.  I introduced an event subclass of church service, and it seemed sensible to change the classing of funeral as a result to a subclass of this new topic.  Other than that, the only point of note is the decision to include Elizabeth's assessment of Margaret Lowther's looks as a occurrence on Margaret Lowther, scoped by the event as well as by Elizabeth Pepys.  The rationale for this is that, whilst previous descriptive additions have been Samuel commenting on an event, this note deserves to be an occurrence on Margaret Lowther herself.  By including a scope of the event a connection is provided to the relevant diary entry, and allows for changing opinion through the course of the diary.
St Olave's church has been added to places.
I left unmodelled a domestic incident regarding control of linen.  Perhaps it might be worth including an incidental event type for this kind of happening, where the nature of the event is included as a description.
