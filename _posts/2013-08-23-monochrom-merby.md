These shots are from my first real shoot with the Leica M Monochrom. 

The event was a men's roller derby bout. Roller derby is predominantly a women's sport, but increasingly UK leagues are gaining a men's team. The men play under the same rules as the women and there are often co-ed bouts. The men's game differs mainly in the fact that men find it hard to use their hips, so contact tends to be with the shoulders or chest. In terms of speed and physicality though I would say there isn't much difference between men's and women's games and co-ed bouts are by no means dominated by the men.

The camera is my new favourite - its perfect for shooting derby because it handles low light impeccably; its small and light; and coupled with Leica lenses it can produce images with breath-taking clarity. Moreover the fact that this is a black-and-white-only camera means that I don't have the horrible colour-casts of sports hall lighting (fluorescent tubes and green walls ... never a good combination), and I can concentrate on shooting images in black-and-white. Having direct access to almost all the principal settings (oh for an ISO dial!), means that I can also play more freely and directly with creative options like slowing down the shutter speed or using a wide-open aperture for selective focussing.
