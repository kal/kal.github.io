<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/06/index.php">Today's sequence of events</a> starts with Samuel receiving the news that his uncle Robert died on the preceding day. So the first event to model is that death.
Samuel pays a visit to William Wight and Lady Jemima Montagu, to inform them of the news, and presumably to excuse his later absence. Although there is an implicit "visits" event - there is nothing explicit in the diary to say where Samuel went to pass on his news. For this reason, I have chosen only to represent the discussion events and not the visit events.
Samuel then proceeds to St. Martin's (St. Martin's Lane) and buys a pair of boots before setting out on his journey. This can be modelled in the same way as his <a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/000040.html">previous purchases</a>.
The journey is modelled as a topic. The route of the journey (from the Post Office in London to the Pepys' farm at Brampton) is modelled using an association, with the location topics playing the roles of journey start and end). As Samuel provides some approximate times for his travels, we can model the timing of the journey using an association. In this case, Samuel gives his start time as between 11am and midday and his arrival time as 9pm. This is modelled using a 3-ary association with two roles delimiting the earliest and latest start time, and one role identifying the end time.
