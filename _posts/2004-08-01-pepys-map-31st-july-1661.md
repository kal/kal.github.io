<p><a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/31/index.php">Today's entry</a> is very short, consisting of a singing lesson, trip to the office theatre trip, and a loan.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>The loan marked the only significant development.  Firstly, I've added a Value topic which has been superclassed to purchase price for more general monetary occurrences.  Topics for the loan event, repayment events, the loan itself, and lender and borrower roles have also been added:</p>
<pre>[value = "Value"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/pepys/#value"]
[loan-event = "A Loan"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/events/#loan-event"]
[repayment-event = "A Loan Repayment"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/events/#repayment-event"]
[lender = "Lender"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/events/#lender"]
[borrower = "Borrower"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/events/#borrower"]
[loan = "Loan"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/events/#loan"]</pre>
<p>Today's loan then is:</p>
<pre>[event-16610731-05 : loan-event
= "Samuel borrows money from Sir William Batten (31st July 1661)";"16610731-05"]
occurs( event-16610731-05 : event,  today : on )
participation( event-16610731-05 : event,
samuel-pepys : borrower,
sir-william-batten : lender,
loan-16610731 : loan )
[loan-16610731 = "Loan from Batten to Pepys"]
{loan-16610731, value, [[Â£40]]} / event-16610731-05</pre>
<p>In honour of the end of the first month of this mapping exercise, I spent last night tidying up all the existing day entries, retrospectively implementing new topics (such as loan).  It's not quite finished yet, but later today or tomorrow I'll be uploading them all.  But for now:</p>
