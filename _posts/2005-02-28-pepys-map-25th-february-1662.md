In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1662/02/25/index.php">today's entry</a> there is just one new addition to the ontology. The events modelled are as follows:
<ul><li>Samuel works at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel and Henry Moore visit a coffee house (that is not named) and discuss the recent storms and the damage caused. I have not modelled the subject of this discussion for the time being.</li>
<li>At some point during the day, Samuel reads a statement written by Charles Sackville regarding the murder that he is accused of. To model this, I have introduced a new association type "text-subject", and modelled Charles Sackville's statement (which is published) as a text, and the murder as the text subject.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at home.</li>
<li>The Hunts visit the Pepys.</li>
<li>Samuel works at the Navy Office again.</li>
<li>Samuel has supper at home.</li>
</ul>
