In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/27/index.php">today's entry</a> Samuel spends the day visiting friends. The following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel goes to Westminster, where he hears a guitar recital.</li>
<li>He goes on the Westminster Hall, where he has a discussion with George Montagu.</li>
<li>He joins his wife and a number of friends at the Kings Wardrobe, where he enjoys a venison pasty.</li>
<li>With his wife, he takes Jemima Carteret and Paulina Montagu to see his house, going via London Bridge to show them the ships.</li>
<li>He sees the Montague daughter home with his wife, and they return to the Seething Lane house.</li>
<li>Finally, he writes to his father.</li>
</ul>

A couple of new introductions to the ontology were required for this entry. Firstly, I added instrument to the roles available for a performance event, and created guitar and voice instances thereof. I also introduced a friend-of association to document the French friend of M d'Esquier; I have therefore added some additional friendship relationships to the people map for those individuals Samuel refers to a friends in the diary. I also added a via role for travelling events, to document the trip home via London Bridge.
Looking over the people map lit the spark of my days as an encyclopedia editor, so I went through all the names and attempted some standardisation of the names. The usual system for indexing is &#x201c;Surname, Name (Honorific) (Title)&#x201d;, for instance &#x201c;Montagu, Edward (Sir) (Earl of Sandwich)&#x201d;; peers should also be indexed via the title, but as LTM only allows for one sort name I opted for the above, as the title itself is indexed separately as part of the office holding event. I have not attempted to standardise the use of Mr and Mrs (except by removing the point for all, in line with modern usage); this is something I will discuss with Kal. An example peerage entry is then:
<pre>
[sir-edward-montagu : man = "Sir Edward Montague (Earl of Sandwich)"; "Montagu, Edward (Sir) (Earl of Sandwich)"
= "My Lord" / samuel-pepys
= "Earl of Sandwich" / sir-edward-montagu-earl-of-sandwich
@"http://www.pepysdiary.com/p/112.php"]
[sir-edward-montagu-earl-of-sandwich : office-holding-event
= "Sir Edward Montagu, Earl of Sandwich"
= "Earl of Sandwich" / sir-edward-montagu-earl-of-sandwich]
participation( sir-edward-montagu-earl-of-sandwich : event,
sir-edward-montagu : office-holder,
earl-of-sandwich : office-held )
[earl-of-sandwich : office = "Earl of Sandwich"]
</pre>
Unnamed people are subindexed to a known connection:
<pre>
[thomas-townshend-wife : woman = "Unnamed Wife of Thomas Townshend";"Townshend, Thomas; wife of"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/pepys/people/#thomas-townshend-wife"]
married-to (thomas-townshend : spouse, thomas-townshend-wife : spouse)
[captain-ferrers-lady : woman = "Unnamed Lady of Captain Ferrers";"Ferrers, Robert; lady of"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/pepys/people/#captain-ferrers-lady"]
friend-of ( captain-ferrers-lady : friend, samuel-pepys : friend )
</pre>
These can, of course, be amended if their identity is later made clear. The latter in particular proved ambiguous as the diary refers to &#x201c;Captain Ferrers' lady&#x201d; &#x2013; the precise relationship being unclear, I could not include a married-to association, so made do with a insinuative friend-of, arched eyebrows and all.
I have also split out non-diary dates to a separate pepys-diary-dates map; later I will move all the diary entry dates there. The dates map provides the Gregorian dates as alternative base names (scoped by a new topic gregorian), and I would propose to additionally provide a name scoped by dairy-entry, as the diary entries name the day of the week, for instance:
<pre>
[date-16610715 : date = "15th July 1661"; "16610715"
= "Monday 15th July 1661"; "16610715" / diary-entry
= "25th July 1661";"16610725" / gregorian
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/date-time/?gDateTime=1661-07-25"]
</pre>
It occurs to me that as the map expands, some editorial guidelines will be very useful. I therefore intend to create an additional map, pepys-diary-editorial, which provides occurences of type editorial note for thematic and ontological topics. This will also be useful if the pool of editors expands beyond Kal and I.
