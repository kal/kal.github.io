<p>I'm back; Kal and I have decided to alternate weeks of updating to lighten the load.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/21/index.php">today's entry</a>, the following events are modelled:</p>
<ul>
<li>The birth of Catherine Montagu (on or before today).</li>
<li>The engagement of Thomas Pepys (the brother) to a Miss Whately (before today).</li>
<li>Samuel visits his father, and together they visit Dr Williams (but he is out), Mrs Terry (Miss Whately's sister, with whom they discuss the engagement), and William Joyce.</li>
<li>They drink in a tavern with Joyce.</li>
<li>They visit Mrs Whately (the mother), but she is just going out, so they go to Whitehall, where they receive the news of the birth.</li>
<li>They revisit Mrs Whately and discuss the engagement.</li>
<li>They return to Samuel's father's house.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at the Wardrobe with the Montagu's (older) daughters.</li>
</ul>

<p>I created an event type of engagement; this is for the whole period, the event of being engaged.  The actual bended-knee occasion would be a proposal event; I haven't created this yet, as we have no details of it.</p>
