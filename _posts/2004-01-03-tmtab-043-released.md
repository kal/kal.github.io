A new release of TMTab, version 0.4.3 is now available for <a href="http://www.techquila.com/tmtab/install.htm">download</a>.
TMTab is a tab-widget plug-in for the <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">Protege</a> ontology editor which enables Protege ontologies to be exported in XTM syntax.
This release is a bug-fix release. The two principle errors fixed are the occassional generation of duplicate ID attribute values for associations and the generation of numeric ID attribute values when using IDs generated from the Protege Knowledge Base objects directly.
This will probably be the last version of TMTab to support the 1.x releases of Protege. The next planned release (0.5.0) will support Protege 2.0. Watch this space!
