Another simple entry <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/29/index.php">today</a> .  Samuel visits a house adjacent to the Navy Office with a view to taking it over, dines and chats with his brother, and then they visit his mother with whom they discuss money.

Not much worthy of note today: I created a topic for &#x201c;John Pepys London house&#x201d; as it is discussed but there is no indication of the address.  News arrives whilst Pepys is at his mother's of three ill relatives; I have included this as a contextual mention, but maybe there should be a simple news event.
Kal and I seem to have different ideas on topic name capitalisation, and it's starting to look a little untidy.  Once I have persuaded him with the forceable use of my heavy copy of the Oxford Style Manual to do it my way, I'll go back and tidy them up.
