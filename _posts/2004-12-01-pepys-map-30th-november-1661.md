Final entry for November. The following events are modelled for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/30/index.php">30th November 1661</a>:
<ul>
<li>Samuel works on legal matters with Lewis Phillips and Dr. John Williams at the Temple. I have assumed that this work is to do with Pepys' Chancery bill against Tom Trice and so have made that the subject of the working-event.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at the Wardrobe.</li>
<li>Samuel travels home from the Wardrobe.</li>
<li>Pepys works at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Pepys, Batten and Cocke drink a bottle of sack at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Pepys returns home from the Navy Office.</li>
</ul>
The monthly roundup will go up soon - it comes out at 3.3 meg of XTM (yikes!). Watch this blog!
