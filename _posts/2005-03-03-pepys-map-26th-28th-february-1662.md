<ul><li>Sam and William Penn travel to Whitehall Palace by coach.</li>
<li>Samuel delivers a map of Tangiers to James Stuart. The map was sent by Sir Edward Montagu and was created by one Martin Beckman. Beckman's position in the employ of Montagu has been modelled as an office-holding event, where the office is ommitted as we are not told the nature of his position.<br/> The map has been modelled as a topic, allowing a text-subject association to connect the map with the territory depicted (Tangiers) and a new created-by association to connect the map with Beckman.</li>

<li>At Mr. Savills, Samuel sits for his portrait.</li>
