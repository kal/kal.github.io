<a href="http://www.tmapi.org/">TMAPI</a> is a community project I started to try to build a common Java API to topic map processing engines. The idea is to try and create something like a DOM for topic maps.
The alpha cycle for the 1.0 release comes to a close on Friday - all comments received before Friday will be taken into consideration for the TMAPI 1.0 beta release which we hope to get out within a few days of the close of the alpha cycle.
TMAPI has a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tmapi">SourceForge project page</a>. We track comments and discussions in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=39237&atid=424686">Bug tracker</a>; discuss and vote on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=39237">mailing list</a> and you can grab the Java code for the interfaces from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=39237">CVS</a>, or alternatively browse the <a href="http://www.tmapi.org/apiDocs/index.html">Javadoc</a> online.

<b>Update:</b><br/>
<a href="http://www.jezuk.co.uk/cgi-bin/view/jez">Jez</a> points out that that last sentence in the first para doesn't sound like a laudable goal. I think it probably should really read:<br/>
"The idea is to try and create something like a DOM for topic maps...only good"
