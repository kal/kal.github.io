<p>In celebration of the first month of the Pepys Map, I've uploaded <a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/166107.zip">a zip file</a> of all the entries for July, including my retrospective revisions and editorial tidying. The zip file also includes all the ontological files, and 166107.ltm which is a simple map that merges all the others.  If you can't be bothered with all of that, then 166107.xtm is the whole lot pre-merged as XTM.</p>
<p>I haven't overwritten the current uploads with the amended entries, in case Kal comes back from holiday and really hates what I've done; so 166107.zip is the &#x201c;guest editor's&#x201d; view of the month, venison pasties and all.</p>
