In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/27/index.php">today's entry</a>, the following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>The maid Dorothy leaves the employ of the Pepys. This is modelled by setting today as the end date for the office-holding event that connects Dorothy to the office of "Pepys' Maid".</li>
<li>Samuel sits for Mr. Savill. This required a new event type of "Portrait Sitting" with Samuel playing the role "Portrait Sitter" and Mr. Savill playing the role "Painter".</li>
<li>Samuel dines with Lady Jemima Montagu.</li>
<li>Samuel and Lady Montagu have a discussion. Pepys gives the subject of discussion as 'divinity' which I have interpreted here by making "Religion" the subject of the discussion event.</li>
<li>Samuel, Robert Ferrers and Henry Moore attend a performance of Hamlet at the Theatre Royal.</li>
<li>Samuel returns home from the theatre.</li>
<li>Elizabeth Pepys and Mary Wight visit Lady Montagu. I have assumed that this event must have taken place after Samuel's visit to Lady Montagu and have finished before his return home.</li>
</ul>
