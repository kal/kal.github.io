Just posted in the <a href="/publications.html">Publications</a> section of the site is an update to the <a href="/tmsinia.html">Topic Map Patterns For Information Architecture</a> paper and a paper presented at XML Europe 2003 on <a href="/topicmapster.html">Peer-To-Peer exchange of topic map information</a>.
Also updated today was the <a href="/psi/thesaurus/">thesaurus PSI document</a> - adding new subjects and bringing the subject indicators in line with the patterns discussed in the new version of the IA paper.
