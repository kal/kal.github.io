Two more entries posted.
The events for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/28/index.php">28th November 1661</a> are modelled as follows:
<ul>
<li>Samuel receives letters from Sir Edward Montagu in Tangier. The letters are brought to him from Whitehall by Will Hewer - although Will didn't carry the letters all the way from Tangier, I have recorded his role as "courier" in the correspondence event.</li>
<li>Samuel and Peter Pett work at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel and Denis Gauden start on a journey to Whitehall but get waylaid at a tavern on Mark Lane.</li>
<li>The pair continue on from the tavern by coach.</li>
<li>Pepys and Gauden visit Sir George Carteret (the Navy Treasurer).</li>
<li>They then visit visit Sir Edward Hyde (the Chancellor).</li>
<li>Pepys and Gauden drink with many others at the Fountain Inn.</li>
<li>Finally the pair walk home.</li>
</ul>
I did not attempt to model the reported news that Montagu recaptured an "Englishman" (a ship ?) belonging to a Mr. Parker.
The events for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/29/index.php">29th November 1661</a> are:
<ul>
<li>Samuel goes to Westminster Hall. This is at the summons of William's Batten and Penn, but this fact is not modelled.</li>
<li>Pepys, Batten, Penn and George Carteret dine as guests of William Coventry.</li>
<li>Pepys, Batten and Penn travel to Whitehall by boat.</li>
<li>The trio disucss Navy business with the Duke of York. Captain Robert Holmes is mentioned as one of the subjects of discussion - this is modelled using an event-subject association. Also mentioned as a subject of discussion is the striking of sails by foreign ships on the Thames - but with no topic to represent this rathe complex subject, I've not attempted to associate it with the discussion event.</li>
<li>Samuel and William Penn attend a performance of the play 'Love at First Sight'. Due to a full house, the pair are forced to separate for the performance. Thus I have modelled each one's participation as a member of the audience separately. Samuel pays 18d for his seat - this is modelled as a purchase-price occurrence on the performance event and scoped by the topic for Samuel.</li>
<li>Samuel returns home via St. Pauls Churchyard.</li>
</ul>
