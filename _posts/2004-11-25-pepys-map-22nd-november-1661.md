The entry for <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/11/22/index.php">22nd November 1661</a> seems to involve a lot of financial transactions. Presumably such transactions occur quite frequently without mention, but in this entry Pepys gives us some idea of the costs of his life-style. The events modelled are:
<ul>
<li>Dinner at the Dolphin with William Batten &amp; family and George Cocke and his wife.</li>
<li>A performance by an unamed group of musicians for the diners.</li>
<li>A payment of 40s made to the musicians for their services. In this case, I have treated the performance event above as the item purchased. As in previous instances, the purchase price of the item is attached to the item using an occurrence.</li>
<li>A payment of 4l. for the dinner. The recipient of this money is not specified.</li>
<li>Samuel travels to the Temple by foot.</li>
<li>Samuel pays 30s. for legal advice from John Fountaine. The advice (the thing purchased) is modelled as an item.</li>
</ul>
Also in this entry a new maid, Sarah, is hired by Elizabeth Pepys, This office-holding event is modelled in the pepys-diary-people.ltm topic map.
