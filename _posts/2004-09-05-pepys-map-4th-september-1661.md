<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/04/index.php">Today's entry</a> is a relatively straightforward one. The events modelled are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Samuel does some work at the chambers of the Privy Seal in the morning.</li>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth visit St. James's Park.</li>
<li>The couple then go to a cookshop and have dinner - including oysters.</li>
<li>A round of visiting ensues:</li>
<ul>
<li>To Margaret Symons (who is out).</li>
<li>To Elizabeth Pearse (who is in, having just given birth to a daughter).</li>
<li>To Samuel's mother, Margaret Pepys - where Sam gets into another argument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
