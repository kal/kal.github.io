<p>Another <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/02/index.php">short entry</a> today.  Samuel spends the morning at the office, dines with his cousin and is visited by his brother, and then rides to Ware (en route to Cambridge); having an enlightening conversation with a Quaker on the way.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>I introduced a practises religion association to document the Quaker's religion. I've also added this to Joseph Hill in people, as he is a Presbyter:</p>
<pre>/* From ontology */
[practises-religion = "Practises Religion"
= "Practised By" / practised
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/culture/#practises-religion"]
[practised = "Practised"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/culture/#practised"]
[adherent = "Adherent"
@"http://www.techquila.com/psi/culture/#adherent"]
/* From people */
practises-religion ( joseph-hill : adherent, presbyterianism : practised )</pre>
<p>Other than that, I've added an en route to role in the travelling list to show when the described journey is a stage on the way to another place.</p>
