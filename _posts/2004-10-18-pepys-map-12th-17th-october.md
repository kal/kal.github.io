A batch update of missed posts from this week, though most of the entries were quite short. A few new people an places have been introduced. One interesting example is that of "The Exchequer" which, like many government functions is the name of both a building and an institution. To avoid the Topic Naming Constraint which requires that two topics with the same name in the same scope get merged, the building and institution are modelled as follows:
<pre>[exchequer-institution : institution = "The Exchequer (institution)";"Exchequer, The;institution"
= "The Exchequer" / institution
@"http://www.pepysdiary.com/p/290.php"]</pre>
<pre>[exchequer-building : building
= "The Exchequer (building)";"Exchequer, The;building"
= "The Exchequer" / building
@"http://www.pepysdiary.com/p/242.php"]</pre>
