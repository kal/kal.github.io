Yes its been a very long time since I last added anything to this blog. Nearly 4 years in fact! I've not been on a round-the-world tour or used the last four years to perfect my violin technique or been living in a closed community that uses only 19th century technology (aka Windows 3.1). Most of my time has been spent working on stuff at my company <a href="http://www.networkedplanet.com/">NetworkedPlanet</a>. And running a startup, and keeping up wiht Topic maps and .NET (amongst other things) have basically taken over most of my time.
But now its time for a restart of my blogging career.
Roll on the next post (hopefully without the 4 year gap this time).
