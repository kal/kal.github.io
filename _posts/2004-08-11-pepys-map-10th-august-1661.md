<p>In <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/10/index.php">today's entry</a> Samuel meets the new chamber maid (and comments on her ugliness).  He is then visited by his father, and in turn they visit his uncle Wight to discuss the estate of Robert Pepys.  He visits and dines with Lady Montagu, and takes some of her children to the theatre with Captain Ferrers.  Finally, they drink back at the Pepys' house.</p>

<!--more-->
<p>One point to note: the children of Jemima Montagu that he takes to the theatre remain unidentified except in number (there are four of them).  As Jemima had a total of 11 children, I haven't tried to guess which, and so created a topic type of "People" for groups of unnamed individuals.</p>
<p>Other than that, I realise that we do not actually have the Montagu's residence as a a topic; which is odd as Samuel visits them so often. I'm going to have to do a little research to find out what it is, and then I'll add it, including modelling the final event of today: Samuel taking them all home.</p>
