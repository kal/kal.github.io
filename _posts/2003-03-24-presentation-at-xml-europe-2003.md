A shameless trail for a new paper...

<!--more-->
XML Europe time shall soon be upon us once again, and Techquila's Kal Ahmed shall be presenting a new paper on the application of topic maps in a peer-to-peer information sharing system.
The paper describes the implementation of a peer-to-peer system based on the <a href="http://jxta.org/">JXTA</a> P2P toolkit and <a href="http://tm4j.org">TM4J</a> topic map engine which allows peers to browse each other's topic map files and which makes a lot of use of <a href="http://techquila.com/pi_topicmapmerging.html">the merging facilities of topic maps</a> to seamlessly integrate information from many peers into a single navigable view.
The application (which will be demonstrated during the presentation) also makes        use of the <a href="http://www.touchgraph.com/">TouchGraph</a> dynamic graph visualisation software and the TMNav topic map UI toolkit (currently a subproject of TM4J).
The paper will be posted to this site shortly...watch this space!
