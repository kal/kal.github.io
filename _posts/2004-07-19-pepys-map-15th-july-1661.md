<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/15/index.php">Today's entry</a> although quite long does not introduce much in the way of new concepts.  The only new event type introduced here is a "meeting-event" to describe the party at the Rose Tavern:

<!--more-->
<blockquote>
Then with Dr. Fairbrother (whom I met there) to the Rose tavern, and called for some wine, and there met fortunately with Mr. Turner of our office, and sent for his wife, and were very merry (they being come to settle their son here), and sent also for Mr. Sanchy, of Magdalen...
</blockquote>
In this quote, the concept of "visit" that we have used so far (a person travels to a location with the intention of being at that location or interacting with another person at that location) is not really applicable to the coincidence of meeting Mr. Turner. So I have introduced a new event type "meeting". However, the later arrivals of Mrs. Turner and Mr. Sanchy are modelled as "visit" events because the text makes it clear that the reason for them coming to the tavern is to meet one or more of the people already there.
This raises an interesting question - is a "meeting" a more general case of a "visit"? In one respect, it is - a meeting could be intentional or unintentional. In another respsect it is not - a meeting involves at least two people, whereas I have previously use a "visit" to model a person travelling to a location. Possibly this points to a need to review the definition of "visit" and refactor those associations where only one person is involved to be a "journey" rather than a "visit" and restrict "visit" events to involving at least two people, one of whom travelled to the location of the visit.
The other change worth noting is that the subject of Robert Pepy's estate has come up again. To link this to the previous mention of this subject (on 13th July 1661), I have added a subject indicator to this topic both for this entry's topic map and the 13th July topic map.
