Today sees the release of the latest version of TM4J, the open-source topic map engine. This release is primarily a bug-fix release, but also enhances the tolog query implementation to enable dynamic association predicates to use a variable for the association type, thus allowing queries such as: <code>$ASSOC(foo, bar)</code> to find the type of all associations between topics <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.
Source and binary distributions can be downloaded from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tm4j/">the TM4J SourceForge page</a>.
