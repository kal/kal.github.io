Slashdot had an article on the site <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/">Cooking for Engineers</a> which has recipes written for the analytical mind (as opposed to lists of recipes of flat foods).
What interested me was the presentation of the recipes. After the standard prose description, is a table of the ingredients <strong>and the method</strong>. Simple, but effective presentation. For example, check out this <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/2004/09/recipe-file-basic-tiramisu.html">
recipe for tiramisu</a> - scroll to the  end first and take a look at the table - it gets the whole process across incredibly easily.
