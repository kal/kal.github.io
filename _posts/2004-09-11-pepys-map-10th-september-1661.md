<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/10/index.php">Today's entry</a> is relatively straightforward to model. The events we find are:
<ul>
<li>Samuel works at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at home.</li>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth buy a chest from an unamed vendor in Wood Street.</li>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth make more purchases at Thomas Fenner's.</li>
<li>Samuel visits his brother Thomas.</li>
<li>Samuel visits Lady Jemima Montague at the Wardrobe.</li>
<li>Samuel dines with the 'young ladies of the wardrobe' -- it is not clear who these ladies are. I have assumed that at least Paulina Montague is one.</li>
<li>Samuel returns home by foot.</li>
</ul>
Also in this diary entry, a name is given for the maid mentioned on the <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/07/index.php">7th September</a> as being hired from William Joyce. I have added a topic for this maid, Mary, and modified the topic map for 7th September to reference this topic. The start date of her employment is also recorded in a new office-holding event.
