A short <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/09/26/index.php">entry</a> today. In which:
<ul>
<li>Samuel works at the Navy Office.</li>
<li>Samuel dines at home.</li>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth go to the theatre to see 'A King and No King' performed. The diary mentions that they travel each way by coach so this is captured as two separate travelling-events preceding and following the performance.</li>
<li>Samuel works at home on his correspondence. No details about the work are given, so this is modelled simply as a generic working event.</li>
</ul>
It is worth noting that the play is one of several collaborations by John Fletcher (already encountered as writer of 'The Tamer Tamed'), and Francis Beaumont. This is modelled in the topic map by using a single 'written-by' association with two players of the 'writer' role.
