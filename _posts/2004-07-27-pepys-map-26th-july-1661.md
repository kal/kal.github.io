<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/07/25/index.php">Today's entry</a> consists mainly of two chance encounters &#x2013; with a Mr. Joseph Hill and with Samuel's friend Henry Moore &#x2013; and the conversations he has with them concerning politics and his uncle Robert's will respectively.

<!--more-->
The abstractions which Mr. Hill and Samuel discuss (the Church, the state, etc.) has led me to introduce a new topic map entitled <a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/pepys-diary-culture.ltm">pepys-diary-culture</a>, in which topics relating to all aspects of culture are included for merging.  This includes politics, religion, and education as well as art and letters.  I shall over the next two weeks be going back over the published entry maps, and transferring relevant topics to the new map.
The continuing references to Samuel's uncle's estate has led to a similar decision with respect to &#x201c;things&#x201d;.  The new map <a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/pepys-diary-artifacts.ltm">pepys-map-artifacts</a> recurring objects, including abstractions such as the estate.
Finally, to faciliate the culture aspect, I've introduced an ontological term of &#x201c;institution&#x201d; as a wide-ranging topic which indicates that a place has organisational or corporate significance. This includes Parliament, university colleges, and so on.
