On a <a href="http://www.shelter.nu/blog-092.html">recommendation</a> I started reading George Lakoff's "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things". In which Lakoff dissects much of what is received wisdom for topic map practitioners. The notion of an objective theory of meaning and particularly of classification is central to a lot of topic map design. That is, we tend to proceed on the notation that there are concepts in the world which are unique and non-overlapping and that those concepts have properties and relationships to other concepts and that we distinguish between classes of "thing" by means of their properties alone.
Lakoff argues (convincingly) that an objectivist approach is not a reflection of the way that we categorise in language and the is not a reflection of the way in which we assign meaning. He also presents some alternative models of categorisation that are better supported by psychological research into the way that people categorise things.
