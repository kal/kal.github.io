The second monthly milestone in the topic mapping of Pepy's Diary has been reached! As Stuart did last month, I've created a single merged topic map for the diary to date (July and August plus a few days from June).
The zipped XTM file can found <a href="http://www.techquila.com/blog/archives/pepys-diary.zip">here</a>.

<strong>Update:</strong> I've now posted <a href="http://www.techquila.com/pepysmap/html/">HTML pages</a> generated from the XTM file for July and August.
See <a href="http://www.techquila.com/pepysmap/html/pepys-map.html">the about page</a> and <a href="http://www.techquila.com/pepysmap/html/help.html">the help page</a> for more details.
