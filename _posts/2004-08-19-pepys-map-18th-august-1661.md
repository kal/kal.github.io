<a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/18/index.php">Today's entry</a> introduces one retrospective event and a small problem (cleared up!).
The retrospective event is the gift of a book made by Henry Moore to Samuel when they met on 7th August. This is easily accomodated, and I have created the event in today's topic map - so that the focus of each topic map is on the content of the diary entry, not on the happenings of the particular day.
The small issue is one of terminology. Up to now I have used the term "Book" to mean a particular text. So, the "Shorter Oxford English Dictionary" and Latham & Matthews annotated diaries were typed as "Book". However, in today's entry I want to record the fact that Sam reads the <em>text</em> <a href="http://www.vts.edu/bpl/hooker.htm">"Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity"</a>, and that he was given a copy of the text as a <em>book</em>. Note the change of terms: the term "Text" is now used to refer to the abstract written work, and "Book" is now reserved for an individual copy of a text.
Much of the rest of the day's entry is straightforward enough. One new person is introduced, Dr Tom Pepys, but I also have added a topic for Richard Hooker (author of the text that Sam is reading).
