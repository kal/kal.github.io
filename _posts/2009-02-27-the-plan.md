In the four years since I last did anything with this blog, things have moved on a bit in terms of blogging systems, so I am considering replacing this MT installation with something a bit more hip, with it and down with the kids....well OK with WordPress anyways. As you can see from the page layout my design skills are somewhat poor but as a dedicated geek I hold fast to the belief that there is nothing that can't be fixed by upgrading.
So all things being equal this weekend I'm going to try and get WordPress on to this site, and transfer all of my old posts over to it. My host has PHP and MySQL so I have the basic WP requirements, so hopefully it should be easy enough. If anyone has any tips or knows of any gotchas in moving from MT 2.6 to the latest WordPress please let me know.
