The TM4J project team have just released the latest milestone in the development of the TM4J core library. TM4J version 0.9.0  implements a major revision of the API from 0.8.x versions which more closely aligns the TM4J API with the standard topic maps data model and with other related standardisation efforts such as <a href="http://tmapi.org/">TMAPI</a>.
Full details and download are <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tm4j/">here.</a>
