TMTab is a plugin for the <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu">Protege ontology editor</a> that enables the creation of topic maps (in XTM syntax).
TMTab version 0.5.0 is a straight-forward port of TMTab to the latest version (2.1 beta) of Protege.
TMTab is released as charity-ware. If you find it useful please consider making a donation to Shelter - the Help / About Plugins... menu option has more details (select TMTab from the list of plugins you have installed!).
