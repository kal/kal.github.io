Just two working events <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/08/20/index.php">today</a>. Pepys works at the Navy Office and then at home.
There is mention in the diary of the Navy Office reaching an agreement with a neighbour to the office, but there is not really enough detail to warrant another event.
