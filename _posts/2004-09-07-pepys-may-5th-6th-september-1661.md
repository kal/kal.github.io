For 5th September, the following events are modelled:
<ul>
<li>Samuel visits his mother.</li>
<li>Samuel does some business at the Privy Seal.</li>
<li>Samuel travels from the Privy Seal's chambers to Thomas Fenner's house, by boat.</li>
<li>Margaret and Paulina Pepys leave London for the Pepys' farm.</li>
<li>Samuel, Elizabeth and some others take a drink at an alehouse.</li>
<li>A footman approaches Elizabeth Pepys with a message. This is modelled simply as a meeting-event.</li>
<li>Dinner at Thomas Fenner's - we only know that Samuel and Elizabeth are guests, we are not told who the hosts are.</li>
<li>Samuel receives the news that his aunt, Julian Clarke, is ill, which prompts an argument with Antony Joyce.<li>
<li>Samuel and Elizabeth go to Bartholomew Fair and see performances by acrobats and tumblers before returning home by foot.</li>
</ul>
For the 6th of September, we have:
<ul>
<li>Thomas Fenner joins Samuel for his morning draught.</li>
<li>The pair then go to visit Julian Clarke during which she expresses her wishes with regards to her estate. The estate of Julian Clarke is introduced as a new topic and made the subejct of a conversation.</li>
<li>Samuel and Thomas go for a drink at some unamed alehouse and then call in at Fenner's sister. The only name we have at present for the sister is given by Pepys as "Utbeck".</li>
<li>Samuel attends a performance of 'Elder Brother' at the Theatre Royal.</li>
<li>Samuel and some friends met at the theatre go drinking at the Ship tavern.</li>
