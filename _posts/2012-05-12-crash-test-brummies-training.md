Crash Test Brummies are a relatively new men's Roller Derby team based (unsuprisingly) in Birmingham. I went down on Sunday to take some pictures at their training session. For a change I used the 5D MkII cranking up the ISO to get shutterÂ  speeds that allowed some freezing of the action. I quite like how they turned out, but I'm itching to do it again on good ol' Tri-X!
